In order to run unit tests, you need the following python packages:

nose (python-nose)
achoo (download from http://web.quuxo.com/products/achoo/)
twill (python-twill)
mox (python-mox)


To run tests:

nosetests -v --rednose --nologcapture --with-doctest tests/webadmin fred_webadmin

Note:
Rednose is a plugin that colours the test results ouput (so it's better
readable). Downloadable from: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rednose/
If you don't want it, just omit "--rednose" option.
