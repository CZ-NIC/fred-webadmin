In order to run unit tests, you need the following python packages:

nose (python-nose)
twill (python-twill) - retwill fork as twill is abandoned
mock (python-mock)


To run tests:

nosetests -v --rednose --nologcapture --with-doctest fred_webadmin

Note:
Rednose is a plugin that colours the test results ouput (so it's better
readable). Downloadable from: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rednose/
If you don't want it, just omit "--rednose" option.
